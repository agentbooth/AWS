AWS Turbo disk controller board

This is a reverse engineering project.
The AWS was an 8088/8086 based computer made by Convergent Technologies in
the mid 1980's.  Some models has the AWS Turbo disk controller.
This handled a 5.25 inch floppy and an MFM hard drive.

It was based on a Signetics N8x300 processor.
This project is fundamentally a disassembly and analysis of the firmware
for this processor.  The purpose of this is a deeper understanding of the
AWS hard drive controller, along with general fun and games.
