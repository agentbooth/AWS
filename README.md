AWS Turbo disk controller board

This is a reverse engineering project.
The AWS was an 8088/8086 based computer made by Convergent Technologies in
the mid 1980's.  Some models had the AWS Turbo disk controller.
This handled a 5.25 inch floppy and an MFM hard drive.

It was based on a Signetics N8x300 processor.
This project is fundamentally a disassembly and analysis of the firmware
for this processor.  The purpose of this is a deeper understanding of the
AWS hard drive controller, along with general fun and games.

The bulk of the "action" is aws.dis.  This is a disassembly, heavily annotated
by comments I have added as I work to understand the firmware.  I update this
regularly as I study and learn more.
